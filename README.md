## Hi there 👋
# 🧬 Welcome to **The Komics Lab**

Hi, I’m **Komal Sharma** — a **skincare founder**, **explorer**, and emerging **bioinformatics enthusiast**.  

At **The Komics Lab**, I combine biology, data, and design to decode how our skin works — from **melanocytes to molecules**. With a Master’s in Computer Science from ASU and extensive experience in IT and management, I found my ikigai in skincare: helping people heal by bridging science and empathy.

My current focus is skin health and pigmentation disorders, particularly **melasma**, a common yet complex condition. To understand it deeply, I study molecular dermatology, cell biology, and bioinformatics — exploring the genes, pathways, and mechanisms behind pigmentation.

At The Komics Lab, I merge technology, data science, and skincare to:

- Decode the molecular basis of skin conditions  
- Apply Python and bioinformatics tools to analyze biological data  
- Translate research insights into practical solutions for skin health  

My work is a blend of research, data analysis, and creative storytelling — where **code meets cells** and curiosity drives innovation.

### 🌿 Current Focus
**Skin & Cell Biology Foundation**  
- Skin structure and cell types (melanocytes, keratinocytes, fibroblasts)  
- Melanin synthesis pathways (TYR, MITF, MC1R, Wnt)  
- Oxidative stress and gene expression  
- Python for bioinformatics (data visualization + gene expression basics)
