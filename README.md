## Hi there 👋
# 🧬 Welcome to **The Komics Lab**

🔭 I’m currently working on building and scaling my skincare brand. 
Hi, I’m **Komal Sharma** — a **skincare founder**, **Explorer**, and an emerging **bioinformatics enthusiast**.  
At **The Komics Lab**, I blend biology, data, and design to decode how our skin works — from **melanocytes to molecules**.
With a Master’s in Computer Science from ASU and extensive experience in IT and management, I often wondered how I ended up in skincare. The answer is simple: I wanted to help people heal. That became my ikigai — the intersection of science, empathy, and purpose.

This passion led me to focus on skin health and pigmentation disorders, particularly melasma, a common yet complex condition. To understand it deeply, I dove into molecular dermatology, cell biology, and bioinformatics, exploring the genes, pathways, and mechanisms behind pigmentation.

At The Komics Lab, I merge my diverse experiences — technology, data science, and skincare — to:

Decode the molecular basis of skin conditions
Apply Python and bioinformatics tools to analyze biological data
Translate research insights into practical solutions for skin health

My work is a blend of research, data analysis, and creative storytelling, aiming to bridge the gap between science and skincare. Here, code meets cells, and curiosity drives innovation.

### 🌿 Current Focus
**Skin & Cell Biology Foundation**  
- Skin structure and cell types (melanocytes, keratinocytes, fibroblasts)  
- Melanin synthesis pathways (TYR, MITF, MC1R, Wnt)  
- Oxidative stress and gene expression  
- Python for bioinformatics (data visualization + gene expression basics)

 🌱 I’m currently learning ...
- **Bioinformatics fundamentals** — sequences, databases, and data pipelines  
- **Cell signaling + pigmentation** — understanding skin from a molecular lens  
- **Python & Data Science** — Jupyter, Pandas, Matplotlib  
- **Scientific storytelling** — turning complex biology into visuals and insights

- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on someone with a knowledge on biopython and melesma to understand in depth, the problem we are facing of hyper pigmentation.

- 🤔 I’m looking for help with someone who has a deep understanding of Bioinformatics and how they would start if they were doing from scratch.
  
### 🌸 Vision
> *To merge scientific exploration, skincare innovation, and creative communication —  
where data tells the story of beauty at a molecular level.*
