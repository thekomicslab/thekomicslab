## Hi there 👋
# 🧬 Welcome to **The Komics Lab**

🔭 I’m currently working on building and scaling my skincare brand. 
Hi, I’m **Komal Sharma** — a **skincare founder**, **Explorer**, and an emerging **bioinformatics explorer**.  
At **The Komics Lab**, I blend biology, data, and design to decode how our skin works — from **melanocytes to molecules**.

---

### 🌿 Current Focus
**Skin & Cell Biology Foundation**  
- Skin structure and cell types (melanocytes, keratinocytes, fibroblasts)  
- Melanin synthesis pathways (TYR, MITF, MC1R, Wnt)  
- Oxidative stress and gene expression  
- Python for bioinformatics (data visualization + gene expression basics)

📘 Documenting daily notes and code in:  
[**Skin & Cell Biology Portfolio →**](https://github.com/thekomicslab/Skin-Cell-Biology-Portfolio)

 🌱 I’m currently learning ...
- **Bioinformatics fundamentals** — sequences, databases, and data pipelines  
- **Cell signaling + pigmentation** — understanding skin from a molecular lens  
- **Python & Data Science** — Jupyter, Pandas, Matplotlib  
- **Scientific storytelling** — turning complex biology into visuals and insights

### 🔬 Tech & Tools
| Category | Tools |
|-----------|--------|
| 🧩 **Coding & Analysis** | Python, Jupyter Notebook, Pandas, Biopython |
| 🧬 **Bioinformatics** | NCBI GEO, Ensembl, KEGG |
| 🎨 **Visualization** | BioRender, Canva, Seaborn |
| 🗂️ **Documentation** | Notion, GitHub Pages |

- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on someone with a knowledge on biopython and melesma to understand in depth, the problem we are facing of hyper pigmentation.

- 🤔 I’m looking for help with someone who has a deep understanding of Bioinformatics and how they would start if they were doing from scratch.
  
### 🌸 Vision
> *To merge scientific exploration, skincare innovation, and creative communication —  
where data tells the story of beauty at a molecular level.*
