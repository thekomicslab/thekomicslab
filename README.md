## 👋 Hi there!

# 🧠 Welcome to **The Komics Lab**

Hey, I’m **Komal Sharma** — a **data science explorer**, **tech storyteller**, and **creative problem-solver** on a mission to turn raw data into insights that matter.

At **The Komics Lab**, I believe that data is more than numbers — it’s a narrative waiting to be discovered. My goal is to transform complex datasets into stories that are insightful, actionable, and beautifully visualized.

With a background in **Computer Science (ASU)**, **IT management**, and **entrepreneurship**, I’ve spent years blending logic and creativity — from building digital products to studying consumer behavior. Now, I bring that same multidisciplinary curiosity into **data science**, exploring how data can reveal what drives decisions, systems, and people.

## 🔍 What The Komics Lab Stands For

**The Komics Lab** is my creative space where I mix:

* 🧪 *Science* — Data analysis, algorithms, and model building
* 🎨 *Art* — Visual storytelling, creative dashboards, and narrative-driven analysis
* 💡 *Insight* — Turning observations into real-world applications

Each project here is built with curiosity first, showcasing not just results — but *how* and *why* those results make sense.

### 🎯 What I’m Learning

I’m currently building a deep foundation in:

* **Python for Data Science** — mastering Pandas, NumPy, and data manipulation
* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** — cleaning, visualizing, and understanding patterns
* **Machine Learning Fundamentals** — regression, classification, and clustering models
* **Data Visualization & Storytelling** — using Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly
* **Statistics & Probability** — applying real-world logic to data-driven problems
* **Project Design** — structuring data workflows using the Data Science Life Cycle
